# FoSH-study-dashboard
I initially developed individual participation pages for the households in my study. My idea was to provide a central place where my participants could log in to and remind themselves of their progress so far. I would also use this space to coordinate the next meeting.

Over the time, this developed into more of a researcher tool than for participants. The dashboard helped me to keep track of the progress of six households over the course of six months. You might find this useful for your own work.
